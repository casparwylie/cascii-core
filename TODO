IMPROVEMENTS (arguably features):
- System theme integration
- Key shortcuts for all menu options (numbered)
- diamond resize bit odd with other layers.
- joiner layer with arrow heads won't always show - zindex.
- captures on every change instead of mouseup
- clever resize: text in boxes main issue
